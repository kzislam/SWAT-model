The hydrological characteristics of a watershed play a crucial role in shaping ecosystems within the
Boreal zone and have a significant impact on regional environments. Knowing these characteristics,
such as the distinctive topography, vegetation, soil composition, and climatic conditions in the
Canadian Boreal ecozone, is essential for implementing sustainable water management. This study
focuses on assessing the hydrological dynamics of the Upper Humber River Watershed (UHRW)in
western Newfoundland, Canada, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool(SWAT) model. The
UHRW includes sub-basins and hydrological response units(HRUs), with diverse land uses, soil
types, and slope characteristics. Key parameters influencing streamflow simulation were identified
through sensitivity analysis, including the runoff curve number, the effective hydraulic conductivity,
the temperature lapse rate, the soil evaporation compensation factor, and the available water capacity
of the soil layer. The SWAT model, using data from the Reidville hydrometric station, shows favorable
performance metrics, with R2 values of 0.79 and 0.83 during the calibration and evaluation periods,
respectively. The model effectively captures seasonal and monthly flow patterns, displaying right skewed distributions and seasonal variations. The analyzed hydrological parameters, such as
precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, surface runoff, and groundwater flow, reveal their
significant contributions to the water balance. The flow duration curve analysis indicates the model’s
capability to estimate peak and lowflows, with slight under-prediction during the recession phase.
Seasonal analysis further supports the model’s performance, with positive Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency
(NSE) values ranging from 0.65 to 0.91. The study concludes that the SWAT model is suitable for
simulating the hydrological processes in the studied watershed providing valuable insights for
sustainable water resource management and decision-making in the UHRW. The results can be useful
for other Boreal ecozone watersheds.
